----------------------------------------------
Linked List :
- sequence of data structures connected together via links

Types:
1) Simple Linked List -> navigates forwards (next) ONLY
2) Double Linked List -> navigate forwards  (next)  and backwards (prev)
3) Circular Linked List -> last element has link to first element as NEXT AND First element has link to last element as PREV

Singly Linked :
- contain link element called FIRST
- each link has data feilds + link field called Next (to link to next link)
- last link has link to NULL (mark end of list)

Singly Linked Operations:
- Insertion 	: at beginning of list 
- Deletion		: at beginning of list
- Display 		: entire list
- Search		: for an element using given key
- Delete		: an element using given key
- Reverse

   
Doubly Linked List :
- link element has data feilds + 2 link fields (next - next link and prev - prev link)
- last link has link to NULL (mark end of list)

Doubly Linked List Operations:
- Insertion 	: at beginning of list 
- Deletion		: at beginning of list
- Insert Last	: at end of list
- Delete Last   : at end of list
- Insert After	: after item on list
- Delete		: element at given key
- Display forward	: complete list in a forward manner
- Display backward	: complete list in a backward manner


Circular Linked List :
- first element points to the last element
- last element points to the first element
-- PS (both Singly - and Doubly - Linked List can be made into a circular linked list)

Circular Linked List Operations :
- Insert : at start of list
- Delete : at start of list
- Display : Display the list
