Java Collections - List
Website : http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-collections/list.html
------------------------------------- 
- can be ordered / items Accessed (get)/ Iterable (looped thru)
- most common of the List interface ArrayList, Linked List, Stack, Vector

Vector	- synchronized (multithreaded apps)
		- similar to Array List
		
Array List	- Pros: References stored in an array ie faster access via indexes
			- Cons: user can may not know number of elements before hand ie 				allocate more space than will be used
			- Cons: reaching max size / adding more space requires creating a new 					arrayList with more	space allocated

Linked List	- Pros: unlike Array list, adding more space add a node with a link 			- Cons: slow to access elements (you have to follow links/references 					to get to node)
